Pumpkin

Pumpkins protect plants that are within their shells.

Toughness: high
Special: can be planted over another plant

Pumpkin hasn't heard from his cousin Renfield lately. Apparently Renfield's a big star, some kind of... what was it... sports hero? Peggle Master? Pumpkin doesn't really get it. He just does his job.
